Refresh Token are typically longer lived than Access Tokens and used to
request a new Access Token without forcing user authentication.
Unlike Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens are only used with the Authorization Server
and are never sent to a web service.

Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.
Access tokens are used as bearer tokens. 
A bearer token means that the bearer can access authorized resources without further identification.

This token is a long-lived token compared to the access token and is used to request a new access token
in cases where it is expired.
It can be considered as credentials used to obtain access tokens.


Refresh tokens carry the information necessary to get a new access token.
Access tokens carry the necessary information to access a resource directly.
